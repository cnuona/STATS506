"The ‘persons with utilization' counts do not reflect beneficiaries who received covered services, but for whom no program payments were reported. Counts and amounts may not sum to totals because of rounding.  The counts also do not sum to totals because beneficiaries may have used both Part A and Part B services during the reported year.",,,,,,,,,
